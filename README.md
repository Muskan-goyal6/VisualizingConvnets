# VisualizingConvnets

Visualizing the output of your machine learning model is a great way to see how its progressing, be it a tree-based model or a large neural network. I used the VGG16 model (pre-trained on ImageNet) available in Keras, on a cat image to see the output of some of the intermediate convolution and their corresponding activation layers.
